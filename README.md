### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Polyglot Software Engineer in love with everything Web, P2P (Peer to Peer) and Data Analytics. I believe decentralization is the key to solving quite a few of the world's computational problems. Experienced in building web applications, internal tools and big data pipelines in the Capital Markets, Publishing, Telecom and Retail spaces.
